            <li>1 Chili Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Bell Pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 oz Cilantro</li>
            <li>10 oz Chicken Breast Strips</li>
            <li>1 TBSP Curry Power</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk</li>
            <li>1 oz Sweet Thai Chili Sauce</li>
            <li>Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
            <li>4 TSP Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>1 TSP Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, combine rice, 3/4 cup water, and a pinch of salt.
                Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender,
                15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into
                1-inch pieces. Zest and quarter lime. Mince cilantro. Thinly slice chili. Place
                chicken on a plate; pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper
                and a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, another large drizzle of oil, and a big pinch of salt to pan with bell
                pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is lightly browned, 3-4 minutes
                (it'll finish cooking in next step). Stir in half the curry powder; cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly shake coconut milk in container before opening. Stir 2/3 cup coconut milk
                (save the rest for another use), chili sauce, stock concentrate, juice from half
                the lime, and 1 tsp sugar into pan with chicken mixture. Bring to a simmer, then
                reduce heat to medium low. Simmer until sauce is thickened, bell pepper is tender, and
                chicken is cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Taste and season with salt and more lime juice
                if desired. Turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.
                TIP: For an extra-rich experience, stir in 1 TBSP butter. Divide rice between shallow bowls
                and top with coconut curry chicken, remaining cilantro, and a pinch of chili if desired.
                Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong><em>Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.</em></strong></p>
