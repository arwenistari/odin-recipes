        <li>2 Scallions</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a medium pot
            of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating
            whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, paprika, a large drizzle of olive oil, and
            a pinch of salt and pepper. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt
            and pepper. Evenly brush tops of chicken with sour cream. Mound panko mixture on top,
            pressing firmly to adhere (no need to coat undersides).
        </li>
        <li>Toss green beans on one side of a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and a
            pinch of salt and pepper. Place chicken crust sides up on empty side of same sheet. Roast
            until green beans are tender and chicken is cooked through, 15-17 minutes. TIP: If green beans are done
            before chicken is cooked through, remove from sheet and continue roasting chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, add couscous to pot. Cook until tender, 6-8 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Melt garlic herb butter in empty
            pot over medium heat. Add scallion whites and cook until softened, 1 minute. Return cooked
            couscous to pot and stir to coat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Once green beans are done, remove sheet from oven; toss with lemon zest and lemon juice
            to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Divide chicken, green beans, and couscous between plates. Garnish chicken with scallion
            greens. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
        </li>
