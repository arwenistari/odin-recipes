            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Wash and dry produce. In a small pot, combine rice, 3/4 cup water and a big pinch
                of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender,
                15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
                </li>
                <li>While rice cooks, trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
                In a small bowl, combin chili sauce, ponzu, half the vinegar, 2 1/2 TBSP sweet soy glaze,
                and 1/2 tsp sugar.
                </li>
                <li>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion
                whites and cook until softened, 1 minute. Add pork and garlic powder; season with salt
                and pepper. Using a spatula, press into an even layer. Cook, undisturbed, until browned
                on bottom, 3-4 minutes. Break up meat into pieces and continue cooking until pork
                is cooked through, 1-2 minutes. Stir in sauce and cook, stirring, until slightly
                thickened, 1 minute more.
                </li>
                <li>Stir red cabbage and carrot mix into pan with pork; cook until just tender, 2-3 minutes.
                Taste and season with salt and pepper. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter until
                melted. Divide rice between bowls; top with stir-fry. Garnish with scallion greens and
                crispy fried onions. Serve.
                </li>
                <p><strong><em>Ground pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.</em></strong></p>
