            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>1 TBSP Butter (Contains <strong>Milk</strong>)</li>
            <li>12 oz Potatoes</li>
            <li>4 oz Button Mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 Potato Buns (Contains <strong>Milk, Eggs, Soy, Wheat</strong>)</li>
            <li>1 unit of Mushroom Stock Concentrate</li>
            <li>10 oz Ground Beef</li>
            <li>2 slices Swiss Cheese (Contains <strong>Milk</strong>)</li>
            <li>3 TBSP Sour Cream (Contains <strong>Milk</strong>)</li>
            <li>1.5 oz Honey Dijon Dressing (Contains <strong>Eggs</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry
                produce. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms
                (skip if your mushrooms are pre-sliced!). Halve buns.
            </li>
            <li>Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and a big pinch
                of salt and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and crisp, 20-25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until lightly browned
                and softened, 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in half the stock concentrate
                (you'll use the rest in the next step) and 1 TBSP water. Cook, stirring, until mushrooms are coated, 30 seconds.
                Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out pan.
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine beef and remaining stock concentrate. Season with salt
                and pepper. Form mixture into two patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun.
                Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in pan used for mushrooms over medium-high heat.
                Add patties and cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. In the last 1-2 minutes
                of cooking, top each patty with Swiss cheese. Cover pan until cheese melts.
            </li>
            <li>While patties cook, toast buns until golden. In a second bowl, combine sour cream
                and honey Dijon dressing. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Spread bottom buns with as much sauce as you like. Top with patties, mushrooms, and top buns.
                Divide burgers and potato wedges between plates. Serve with any remaining sauce on the side
                for dipping.
            </li>
            <p><strong><em>Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.</em></strong></p>
